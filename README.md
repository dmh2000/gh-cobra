# gh-cobra

A simple exercise using Github Cobra CLI to create an app that accesses the Github REST and GraphQl API's.
It also gives help on basic Bash utilities.

## Commands

- $gh-cobra api
  - Print a list of public repositories on Github that belong to a specified owner.
  - Uses the Github REST API
  - see cmd/api.go
- $gh-cobra graphql
  - Print a list of public repositories on Github that belong to a specified owner.
  - Uses the Github Graphql API
  - This command requires a Github bearer token in the environment variable GITHUB_TOKEN
  - see cmd/graphql.go
- $gh-cobra explain
  - print help for basic Linux Bash utilties
  - This command requires an OpenAI api key in the environment variable OPENAI_API_KEY
  - see cmd/explain.go and cmd/lc.go

## Notes

- Built with Go version 1.8 or later
  - Run the app without building : 'go run . args..."
  - Build the app : 'go build ."
- The 'explain' command may give a warning like "Failed to calculate number of tokens...".
  - This warning is generated by the version of Langchain used in this app.
- You can add more to the list of supported names in the 'explain' command by updating the list in lc.go
